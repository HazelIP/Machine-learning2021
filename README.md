# Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains 2 Jupyter notebooks and a csv file, for the purpose of demostrating 3 algorithms from the `Scikit-learn` python package, and running ANOVA using `SciPy.stats` python package. 

The **Scikit-learn notebook** contains an overview of the `Scikit-learn` packgage and a brief introduction of *machine learning*. It then goes on to introduce 3 algorithms from the package, namely *Decision Tree*, *Bootstrap Aggregating* and *Random Forest*, and demostrate how to run them using the `wine dataset` built-in to Scikit-learn package. 

The second notebook in the repository is **ANOVA notebook**. It contains an overview of `SciPy.stats` package, and an introduction of ANOVA. `crop_data.csv` is used in this notebook to demostrate how to check if the data meet the assumptions of running ANOVA, and how to interpret the results after running ANOVA.
